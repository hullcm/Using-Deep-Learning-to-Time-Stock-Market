These repo houses my notebook which predicts future NASDAQ Index values using Deep Learning (LSTM)

With the rise of online trading tools like Robinhood, historically low interest rates and a
perpetually climbing stock market, more individuals are partaking in the highly speculative
practice of options trading. In traditional financial and economic theory, we know that arbitrage
opportunities should not exist systematically. However, we also know that the market is
imperfect and as such these opportunities do arise from time to time. This paper aims to explore
the application of data mining techniques to optimize stock trading strategies.

While the rise of day trading amongst individual investors is a relatively new trend, the
application of advanced data mining techniques to the financial markets is certainly not new.
Hedge funds, investment managers, and advanced researchers have developed state of the art
algorithmic trading approaches that have been in production for many years.

This paper does not aim to produce any novel algorithmic trading approaches, but rather to
explore how an individual can apply data mining techniques to a small scale, individualized
trading portfolio. Many of the existing research efforts have gone towards optimizing for
large-scale portfolios and assume the availability of extensive capital; my research will focus
only on the applicability to an individual, early stage investors portfolio. Personally, my hope is
to use these results to guide my own investment strategies moving forward.

More specifically, the question my research aims to answer is : Can we use machine learning,
deep learning, and other data mining techniques to identify the best entry point for
investing in the stock market? My goal is to predict when short-term dips will occur so that I
can use those dips as an entry-point into the market.
